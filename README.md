Introduction
The Web ordering system is to provide the cafeteria with the next day's dishes as a reference. It is used HTML5 + CSS3 + JS(jQuery)for front-end development . The database uses the local database WebSQL , and does not use back-end development. The system implements the following basic functions:
-There are three homepage navigation: Homepage, My Orders, and Order Statistics
-In the home page:
  Display the dishes of the day, hot dishes, recommended dishes, and display complete information.
  Realize the ordering, the results are displayed in the appropriate position, and the ordered dishes can be canceled.
  The "submit" of a la carte is to save the data locally and then reproduce it in "My Order".
-In the My Orders page, data can be extracted from the data center stored locally and displayed, and can be added and deleted.
-On the order statistics page, the statistics of the top three most popular dishes of the day are displayed in a graph. The statistical results use different types of charts to display the following dimensions: dishes, prices, tastes, and ingredients.
